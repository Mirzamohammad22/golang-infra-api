### USAGE
```
cd <GOPATH>/src/github.com/
git clone git@github.com:Mirzamohammad22/golang-infra-api.git
cd Mirzamohammad22/golang-infra-api
go get -d ./...
go run main.go
```

### ASSUMPTIONS
For the simplicity of the task and to avoid any misconceptions around the task. Assumptions made during the solving the task has been documented

* Config had no unique id, hence alertName was assumed to be unique
* AlertID should match the length of input alert id (len=24), hence a hash of the alertName is used. Else ideally would use UUID for this generation
* Summary of the alerts had to be provided seperately instead of consolidating it into a bigger response json.


### DESIGN QUESTION

Question:
Providing that the external API may be unreliable and the alert configurations can be changed by sneaky SREs manually, how would you design such an application to ensure thereâ€™s no accumulated drift between the real alerts and the desired alerts configuration?

Answer:
    a) Cron Jobs: We can run the application as a scheduled cron-job(eg: every 30mins) to request the External Api for its alerts and compare it with the configuration.If there are any deviations, send a POST request to the API for correction. This cron-job could be via numerous ways eg( github workflows, kubernetes cronjobs, aws Lambda)
